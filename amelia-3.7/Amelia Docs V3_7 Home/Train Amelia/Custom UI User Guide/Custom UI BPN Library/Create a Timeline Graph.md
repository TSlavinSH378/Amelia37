Figure. doTimelineGraph BPN
# Create the BPN
In the Amelia administration pages, use the Process Memory and Process Knowledge links to create a new BPN model and name it doTimelineGraph. Save the new model then build each of the BPN tasks as described below.
Table. BPN Specifications to Create Suggested Responses

The Script editor will appear.Type or copy/paste code from below into the Script editor. If needed, select Groovy as the language. |
| 3 | send the integration message jsonString | Sends the variable jsonString to Amelia's interface for display of interactive calendar |
| 4 | say that was a timeline graph |  |

Once the BPN tasks are built and defined, finish with these steps:
-   Click the Save tab
-   Click the Deploy tab
These steps load the BPN model into Ameliaâ€™s memory.
