The Analytic Memory page displays Journey Analytics which show the conversation and resolution flows as Amelia handles conversations. The flow diagram begins with the number of conversations on the left then evolves to include conversations Amelia covered and conversations she escalated.Â Above the flow diagram are graphs to show her performance over a designated time period. Mouse over a line node in the top graphs to display counts.
The AUTHORITY_JOURNEY_VIEW authority is required to view the graph. This authority is included in the Admin, Agent, Agent Supervisor, Knowledge Designer, Power User, and RBAC Administrator roles.
