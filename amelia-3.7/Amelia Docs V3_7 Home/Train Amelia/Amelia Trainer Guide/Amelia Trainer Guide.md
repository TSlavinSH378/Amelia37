Training Amelia involves preparing data and creating models she uses to process utterances and respond in a helpful way. These tasks use the Amelia Trainer pages located on the left side navigation of the V3 administration site.
These types of data are used to help Amelia understand user utterances in a conversation:
-   **Intents** can connect specific user phrases and responses from Amelia to confirm an intent or call a BPN. For example, "I lost my hotel bill. How can I get a new one?" expresses a goal, retrieve a hotel bill.
-   **Entities** capture key data Amelia needs to complete her tasks and can be referenced in one or more BPNs. For example, to retrieve a hotel bill, Amelia needs to know the person's name, dates for checkin and checkout, and other data stored as entities.
-   Pre-existing chat conversations, classifiers, and other data sources are used to create **annotated models** to train Amelia.
Intents, entities, and annotating data are ways to train Amelia how to process and understand natural language, the natural unconstructed way people talk. This diagram shows the high level conversation flow Amelia uses to process utterances with intents and entities.
