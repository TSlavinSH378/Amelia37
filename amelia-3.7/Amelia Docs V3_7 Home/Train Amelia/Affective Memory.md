Amelia V3 improves the ability to see in real time how she responds positively or negatively to conversations. There also tools available to shape Amelia's emotional responses during conversations, for example, pre-defined responses organized into response pools.
# Affective Memory Panel
One measure is the Pleasure Arousal Dominance (PAD) and Satisfaction graphs available in the Affective Memory tab of the Mind panel of the chat interface. Both graphs display measures of the emotional quotient for users and Amelia as they interact. The Mind panel is available by clicking the Mind link at the top right of the Amelia V3 chat interface.

Figure. PAD and Sentiment Analysis Graphs
The PAD graph represents every emotion in a three-dimensional plane, in a range measured from -1 to 1. Pleasure measures positive or negative attitude, arousal measures energy level, and dominance measures control. The graph describes and measures the emotional (affective) state of Amelia and the user during a conversation.
Amelia’s overall mood is always positive. When her mood trends negative, she expresses concern and hands off the conversation to a human for resolution. Amelia’s emotions, as expressed in the PAD graph, are also used to generate her facial expressions and mannerisms.
The Satisfaction Graph below the PAD diagram shows the evolution of Amelia’s mood over time, as a grey line. The green line is the satisfaction threshold and the red line the negative threshold. When Amelia’s satisfaction line remains too long in the red, she will hand off the conversation to a human.
# Emotion Predictions and Responses
In Amelia V3, every dialog turn generates a new emotion prediction for Amelia and the user based on PAD and OCC (Ortony, Clore, and Collins) methods, as well as user personality traits. PAD emotions are based on a set of Deep Learning models and linguistic rules. OCC emotions are based on dialogue performance metrics, for example, misunderstandings and dialog actions. A final emotion score is created from the merger of PAD and OCC emotion scores. User personality traits also are predicted, for example, extroversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and conscientiousness.
Amelia's facial cues and language speed also are affected by her emotional state and user's emotional state. She speaks more slowly when the conversation trends negative and more quickly when the conversation is positive. She also picks up on the formality of user utterances, responding in a relaxed way when the user converses with slang and shorter sentences. Her non-verbal behavior is based on the sentence she is about to utter.
