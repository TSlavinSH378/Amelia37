# Getting Started
## Welcome
This video covers the welcome message and learning objectives.
## Introduction to Amelia
This video introduces how Amelia interacts with a user.
## Logging Into Amelia 
This video covers how to login to the Amelia instance via a web browser.
## Concepts & Terminology 
The video covers the concepts and general conversation flow in Amelia.
# Intents
Intents define user goals and intents, often with a reference to expected data and utterances required to meet the goal. For example, to retrieve a copy of a hotel bill, an intent might include the utterance, "I lost my hotel bill. Can you send me a copy?"
## Intents
This video covers the definition, concept of Intent, and a demo on creating an Intent in Amelia.

## Intents Modeling Process, Algorithms, and Statistics
The video introduces the modeling of classification processes and the best practices to create intents.
# Business Process Network (BPN)
A Business Process Network (BPN) is a flexible and extensible way to guide Amelia's behavior in her interactions. They define a process flow needed to identify and resolve multiple goals and use cases.
## BPNs
The video covers the elements and steps to create a Business Process Network (BPN) flow in Amelia.

## Say and Ask Tasks
This video covers the steps to create Say and Ask tasks in Amelia.
## Service Prefix - Response
This video covers how to create a user-response related navigation response in the BPNs.

## Putting It Together: Connecting Intents and BPNs
This video covers how to connect Intents to BPNs in Amelia.

## BPN Version Control
This video covers how to view and edit different versions of a BPN.
vimeo.com
## BPN Script Tasks and Libraries
This video introduces the elements and process to create a script task and using scripts from Script Library in BPNs.
vimeo.com
## BPN Scripting Services: Content Management Service
This video covers the functions of Content Management Service in the BPN Scripting Services.
# Entities
Entities capture data from user utterances that Amelia needs to fulfill a user request. Entities are the pieces of data needed to achieve a goal or intent. For example, dates, locations, names, and other data are defined as entities then used by Amelia to capture data and complete a conversation.
## Amelia Trainer: Entities
This video introduces how Entities extract user responses from questions in Amelia.
vimeo.com
## Custom Datum Entity
This video covers when and how to use the custom datum entity type in Amelia.
vimeo.com
## Putting It Together: Entities and ask for the slot
This video covers the steps and processes of using entities in a BPN via an ask for the slot task. 
vimeo.com
## BPN Context Switching
This video introduces how Amelia handles multiple intents from a user via BPN context switching.
## Ask Behavior and Confirmation
This video covers the steps and best practices of ask behavior and confirmation from a user in conversation with Amelia.
vimeo.com
## Role Entity
This video covers the elements and steps to create Role Entities to train a classifier when there are two or more entities of the same datum type in the same utterance.
## Spanless Entity
This video covers the elements and steps to create Spanless Entity and its associated validation data set.
# Other Subsystems
## Semantic Memory Intent FAQ, Semantic FAQ, and Manual
This video covers the components and functions of the Semantic Memory subsystem in Amelia.

# Integration Framework
Amelia's integration service runs separately from Amelia, possibly located on another host or hosts, and allows her to interact with third-party external systems, for example, to generate an insurance quote.
## Introduction to Integration Framework
This video introduces the functions and processes of the Integration Framework in Amelia.
