### "I was trying to X and it didn't work!"
**Solution**: First things first, if this is how you report an issue you have a different problem ![](images/icons/emoticons/smile.svg) For any report, start by clearly identifying these things:
1.  what you were trying to do
2.  the steps you took to do it
3.  what the resulting behavior was
4.  what the expected behavior was if the actual was different
As you answer these questions, you may even find a more relevant solution contained on this page!
### "When I go to a page nothing shows up in the list and a red message pops up saying 'Forbidden.'"
**Solution**: This means that your user account does not have the required authority to access the requested resource. 
### "I cannot see any instances when viewing the list."
**Solution**: Verify that you belong to a [user group](http://dtools.ipsoft.com/confluence/display/CO/Authorization+Guide) for the same [client](http://dtools.ipsoft.com/confluence/display/CO/Client+Guide) as the [instances](http://dtools.ipsoft.com/confluence/display/CO/Instance+Guide) you are looking for.
### **"I cannot test my instance before I save it."**
**Solution**: Make sure that all fields in the edit modal are filled out.
### "When I click the details button on a content type a yellow message pops up saying 'Content is not available.'"
**Solution**: This indicates that there is either no content to fetch from the instances/domain or there was an issue with the engine service while fetching the content.
