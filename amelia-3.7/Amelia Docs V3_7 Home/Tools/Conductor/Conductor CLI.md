The Conductor Engine CLI application enables users to leverage the functionality of the Conductor engines from their command line. This includes the ability to migrate knowledge and configuration options between Amelia instances, Git repositories, etc. As an added utility function, the ability to export metrics is also included in the application.
# Intended Audience
This page and instructions are intended for Amelia admins and engineers that regularly need to migrate Amelia content and configuration changes or export metrics.
# Required Authorities
> [!warning]  
>
> The authorities detailed here are specific to each content type, to access any content the authority AUTHORITY_ADMIN_VIEW must be added as well.

The user account used to authenticate the tool will need to have the appropriate authorities to modify content within an Amelia instance. They are as follows:
## Knowledge Resources
Each type of content requires specific user authorities to be set in Amelia's Settings/Configuration section in her administration workspaces.

Different BPN import and deployment strategies are available in BPN import command in Conductor V3.7.12 onwards. Below is the description using help amelia-bpn-import command.
**help amelia-bpn-import**
``` groovy
conductor-cli:>help amelia-bpn-import
NAME
    amelia-bpn-import - Import BPNs into an Amelia instance.
SYNOPSYS
    amelia-bpn-import [--url] string  [--directory] string  [--domain-code] string  [[--names] string]  [[--ids] string]  [[--import-strategy] import-strategy]  [[--deploy-strategy] bpn-deploy-strategy]  [--with-dependencies] 
OPTIONS
    --url  string
        [Mandatory]

    --names  string
        [Optional, default = ,]
    --ids  string
        [Optional, default = ,]
    --import-strategy  import-strategy
        Following import strategies are available -
        ADD - import BPN only if it's not available in target.
        MERGE - import and updates the BPN if they are not same.
        OVERWRITE - import the BPN after deleting existing one if available.
        [Optional, default = MERGE]
    --deploy-strategy  bpn-deploy-strategy
    Following BPN deploy strategies are available to choose from :
    0 - No deployment of imported BPNs.
    1 - Attempts to deploy only specific BPNs that are imported. (Preserve source deployment status)
    2 - Attempts to deploy all specific BPNs that are imported. 
    3 - Deploys the latest revision of dependent BPNs (Preserve source deployment status of imported BPNs).
    4 - Deploys the latest revision of dependent BPNs (Attempts to deploy all imported BPNs).
    [Optional, default = 3]
    --with-dependencies
        Use this flag to import all dependencies associated with the BPN within the domain.
        (for eg. run the workflow tasks, escalation queue, script, integration flow, intent, entity, response pool and multimedia.)
        [Optional, default = false]
conductor-cli:>
```
## Scripts
Scripts can be written as a list of any of the commands from the previous section. A script file is a simple plain text file that can be created in any text editor. To run a script file, add it to the end of the command used to start the application starting with an **@**Â symbol before the file path.
**Run a script file**
``` text
java -jar conductor-engine-cli-<version>.jar @path/to/script/file
```
> [!warning]  
>
> Do not forget to start your file path with an **@** symbol.
> [!warning]  
>
> For any option that takes a directory as a value, do not forget to use your operating systems file path separator. This is usually a backslash **\\** on Windows or forward slash **/** on macOS and \*nix systems.

Scripts allows customization of Conductor processes to accomplish a variety of goals. An example script for exporting content from an Amelia instance can be found below.
> [!warning]  
>
> Scripts are very much just plaintext files, they do not require a specific file extension and do not have any ability to use variables or conditional logic, they do support comments using '//'. This feature uses the 'script' command built into Spring Shell,Â [read more here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-shell/docs/2.0.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#script-command)Â at [docs.spring.io](http://docs.spring.io).

```
The above script will log in to the Amelia instance specified by theÂ **--url** option. Note, this will prompt for a username and password, those can be specified with the **--username**Â andÂ **--password**Â options respectively to avoid being prompted.
> [!warning]  
>
> If you would like to run a script without being prompted and not include the username and password in the script file, outside values such as environment variables can be passed in like so:
>
> ``` groovy
> printf "email\npassword\n" | java -jar conductor-engine-cli-<version>.jar @path/to/your/script
> ```
>
> This assumes that both the username and password are not included.

This command must be executed first to allow any of the following commands to run using the same Amelia instance URL. Each following command will then be run in sequence.
### **Import a Domain with Content into an Amelia Instance**
Another script can be written to import the content that was exported into another instance.
**Import a domain with content into an Amelia instance**
``` groovy
//
// This script will import all of the most used knowledge content from a local directory into an Amelia instance.
// The local directory used should contain content that was previously exported with Conductor.
// The domain configuration will also be imported with its dependencies.
// The order in which commands are executed matters when importing so dependencies can be properly resolved.
// This example scripts follows the latest recommended import order.
// This script will also handle logging in and out of the instance and exiting the CLI application once finished.
//
// login to the specified Amelia instance
amelia-login https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// import the domain configuration, this will create or update domain and import set of the dependencies required by the domain. 
// Give --parent-code to set the parent domain code for the domain which is getting imported.
// Authentication policy setting for the domain will be same if it is already available in target instance otherwise authentication system/policy gets imported. 
amelia-domain-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target --parent-code ncp_target_parent 
// import AIML content, no dependencies required
amelia-aiml-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target

// import semnet document content, no dependencies required
amelia-semnet-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target
// import multimedia content, no dependencies required
amelia-multimedia-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target
// import response pool content, no dependencies required
amelia-response-pool-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target
// import grammar content, no dependencies required
amelia-grammar-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target
// import entity content, dependant on grammars and tabular data

// import NLU settings
amelia-nlu-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target
// import classifier model content, dependant on intents, entities, and training documents
// To import classifier in bulk, use the following flag : --bulk
amelia-classifier-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target
// import script library content
amelia-script-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target
// import integration asset content

amelia-integration-flow-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target
// import escalation queues and the escalation teams that are associated with it.
amelia-escalation-queue-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target
// import BPN content
amelia-bpn-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target
// import the domain configuration, this will update domain configuration. Give --parent-code to set the parent domain code for the domain which is getting imported.
amelia-domain-import --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target --parent-code ncp_target_parent
// log out of the Amelia instance
amelia-logout https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// shut down the application, it is important to include this otherwise the CLI process will not finish and return control back to the parent shell
exit
```
The above script will log in to a different instance than the one used in the previous export script. These two scripts could even be combined into one, the application will allow a user to be logged in to multiple Amelia instances at a time.Â 
The next command will import the domain configuration, creating it if it does not already exist.
The subsequent commands import the various content types in an order that takes into account their dependencies.
> [!warning]  
>
> The order in which content is imported is very important! The example above is the recommended order taking into account content that may depend on each other, i.e. BPN should be the last thing imported since it may rely on several other types of content.

### **Clean Content from a Target Domain**
One more example script, this time for cleaning/deleting content in an Amelia instance.
**Clean content from a target domain**
``` groovy
//
// This script will clean (delete) all of the most used knowledge content in an Amelia instance.
// The order in which commands are executed matters when cleaning so dependencies can be properly resolved.
// This example script follows the latest recommended import order.
// This script will also handle logging in and out of the instance and exiting the CLI application once finished.
//
// login to the specified Amelia instance
amelia-login https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// clean all BPN content, usually happens first because of the many potential dependencies
amelia-bpn-clean --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --domain-code ncp_target
// clean all classifier model content, needs to happen before intents and entities
// Bulk clean can be used to delete all classifier models in a faster way. Use following flag : --bulk
amelia-classifier-clean --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --domain-code ncp_target
// clean all entity content, needs to happen before tabular data
// Bulk clean can be used to delete all entities in a faster way. Use following flag : --bulk
amelia-entity-clean --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --domain-code ncp_target
// clean all intent content, needs to happen before grammars
// Bulk clean can be used to delete all intents in a faster way. Use following flag : --bulk

// log out of the Amelia instance
amelia-logout https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// shut down the application, it is important to include this otherwise the CLI process will not finish and return control back to the parent shell
exit
```
> [!warning]  
>
> The order in which content is deleted is also important. The above example is the recommended order, and you may notice that it is the reverse of the import order.
> [!warning]  
>
> Don't forget to include the 'exit' command at the end of every script file. If this is not present, the CLI application process will continue to run.

### Migrate Authentication Systems and Policies
Additional example scripts for system configuration settings are below.
**Migrate authentication systems and policies**
``` groovy
//
// This script exports authentication polcies and systems from one instance and imports them in another.
// This script will also handle logging in and out of the instances and exiting the CLI application once finished.
//
// log in to the specified Amelia instance
amelia-login https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// export authentication policies and the authentication systems they depend on
amelia-authentication-policy-export --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source

### Users and User Groups Commands
**Commands for users and user groups.**
``` groovy
//
// Below are export, import and clean commands available for users and user groups in an Amelia instance.
// NOTE: Imported users will not have passwords set if using the Default Authentication policy, the system does not allow these passwords to be exported.
//
// export users as well as the groups, roles, and authentication polcies they depend on
amelia-user-export --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_source

// Following user import strategies are available to choose from :
//  0 - Import only users (maps with only default authentication policy).
//  1 - Import users and maps existing user group and auth policy only if it's present in target.
//  2 - Import users with dependencies (imports user group & authentication policy if they are not present in target).
amelia-user-import --url https://Another_Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target

```
### Migrate UI Bundles
**Migrate UI Bundles**
``` groovy
//

// This script will also handle logging in and out of the instances and exiting the CLI application once finished.
//
// log in to the specified Amelia instance
amelia-login https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// export UI bundles
amelia-ui-bundle-export --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source

// shut down the application, it is important to include this otherwise the CLI process will not finish and return control back to the parent shell
exit
```
### Migrate with Dependencies
**Migrate with dependencies**
``` groovy
//
// This script command exports BPNs or domains configuration along with all dependencies from one instance and imports it into another.
// NOTE: Only dependencies which are present in the domain mentioned in the command gets migrated.
// To enable this feature, following flag is required : --with-dependencies
// For migrating  specific BPNs using names or ids, use the following : --names {comma separated names} --ids {comma separated ids}
// This script will also handle logging in and out of the instances and exiting the CLI application once finished.
// NOTE: BPNs and Domains can have a lot of dependencies. It is likely that when running this script more than just a bpn or domain file will be exported.
// The files exported will only contain additional configurations required by the BPN or Domain, NOT the rest of the content that is in the domain. 
// The content specific commands are to be used for those activities, these commands are for migrating along with their dependencies.
// log in to the specified Amelia instance
amelia-login https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// export domain configuration and all of its dependencies
amelia-domain-export --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_source --with-dependencies
// log out of Amelia instance
// export BPN content
amelia-bpn-export --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_source --with-dependencies
// log out of Amelia instance
amelia-logout https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// log in to another Amelia instance
amelia-login https://Another_Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// import a domain and all of its dependencies, give --parent-code to set the parent domain code for the domain which is getting imported.
amelia-domain-import --url https://Another_Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_source --parent-code ncp_parent --with-dependencies
// import BPN content
amelia-bpn-import --url https://Another_Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-code ncp_target --with-dependencies
// log out of Amelia instance
amelia-logout https://Another_Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// shut down the application, it is important to include this otherwise the CLI process will not finish and return control back to the parent shell
exit
```
### Metrics Export
**Metrics export command**
``` groovy
//
// This script will export Amelia conversation metrics and transcripts from a list of domains for a given date range.
// This script will also handle logging in and out of the instances and exiting the CLI application once finished.
// To export metrics from list of domain, use comma separated domain codes like : --domain-codes domain1,domain2,domain3
// --start-date and --end-date should be in following date format: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ
// To include context, use following flag : --include-context
// To include escalation, use following flag : --include-escalation
// To include transcript, use following flag : --include-transcript
// To create Eddie replay test files for each conversation exported, use following flag : --replay
//
// log in to another Amelia instance
amelia-login https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// export Amelia conversation metrics
amelia-metrics-export --url https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia --directory /tmp/conductor/playgroundv4/ncp_source --domain-codes ncp_source --start-date 2021-01-01T10:15:30.00Z --end-date 2021-07-19T10:15:30.00Z --include-context --include-escalation --include-transcript --replay
// log out of Amelia instance
amelia-logout https://Amelia_URL_path/Amelia
// shut down the application, it is important to include this otherwise the CLI process will not finish and return control back to the parent shell
exit
```
## Thread Pool Configuration
Maximum threads in the thread pool can be customized in Conductor using the below command. By default, the thread pool size is set to 16.
**Thread pool setting**
``` groovy
// below command will increase the maximum thread in thread pool to 20
thread-pool-setting --threadCount 20
```
## Logging Configuration
Rather than having application-specific controls, the best way to customize the logging behavior is by supplying a configuration file as a system property when running the application. Using this file when running the application can be done like so:
**Run the application with a custom logging configuration file**
``` groovy
java -Dlogging.config=/path/to/logback.xml -jar /path/to/jar
```
More information about the available configuration options can be found [here](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html).
# File System OutputÂ

# FAQs
## What version should I use?
The Conductor CLI application is versioned to match up with Amelia core. When you use the application with an Amelia instance, you should use the version that matches the Amelia instance. See the following chart to determine which version of the CLI should be used with which version of Amelia.

| Amelia/Conductor | 3.7.x | 4.0.x | 4.1.x | 4.2.x | 4.3.x |
| ----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 3.7.x |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.0.x |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.1.x |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.2.x |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.3.x |  |  |  |  |  |

Using mismatched versions can result in errors due to breaking changes made to the APIs as new features are added to Amelia. For example, using a 3.7 version of the CLI with a 4.2 version of Amelia could have errors because the CLI is not aware of new things in 4.2. In the opposite scenario, using a 4.2 version of the CLI with a 3.7 version of Amelia will cause errors because the CLI expects to see new things that are not there.
## Can I move content between major/minor versions of Amelia?
Yes, but there is a catch. Major and minor versions can include breaking API changes, this is why Conductor releases are versioned to match. The corresponding Conductor version is aware of that version's API, so using it with another version has the potential to cause issues. That being said, it would not be wise to use, for example, Conductor 4.3.0 to export content from your 3.7.x Amelia instance, and vice versa. To move content from a 3.7 instance to a 4.3 instance, content would be exported from the 3.7 instances with a 3.7 version of Conductor and then the content could be imported into a 4.3 Amelia instance with a 4.3 version of Conductor.

> To run the V3 compatible versions Java 8 is required to be installed on the host machine. To run the V4 compatible versions Java 11 is required to be installed on the host machine. We build and test using the Amazon Corretto JDK, other JDK distributions should work but are not tested by the developers. If managing multiple Java versions is an issue it is recommended to use the Docker image instead.
