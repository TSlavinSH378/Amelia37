IPsoft works closely with our clients to adapt Amelia to work to meet their unique circumstances and needs. Deploying Amelia is a traditional software development exercise and training Amelia as if she is a new employee.
The new hire process involves training Amelia in the words, phrases, and concepts she has to master to support people she converses with. Her goal is to determine user intent then help people accomplish their goals. The software development process involves discovery and definition of the problems to be solved, design of possible solutions, building and testing solutions, and realizing the value from the software.
