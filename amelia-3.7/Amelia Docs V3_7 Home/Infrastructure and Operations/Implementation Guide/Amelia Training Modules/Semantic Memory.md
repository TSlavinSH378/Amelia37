> Please note this page is a work in progress. Content is likely to change as Amelia V3 evolves and more in-depth documentation becomes available.

The Semantic Memory feature in Amelia V3 captures raw data which she indexes to make the data searchable and available during conversations. Only FAQs require a file structure for import. Raw data can be spreadsheets with questions and answers, Wikipedia entries, or other simple but well-curated documents. Semantic memory creates a customized search engine index for Amelia with results available to respond to questions and requests.
