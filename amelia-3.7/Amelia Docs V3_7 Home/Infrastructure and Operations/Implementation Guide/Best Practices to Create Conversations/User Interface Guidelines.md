There are several possible user interfaces for an Amelia system, depending on the customer requirements:
-   Basic website interface with the Amelia avatar, a chat box, and a conversation area
-   A website interface with the basic elements but also data from the conversation displayed to one side of the screen, for example, data Amelia collects to generate an insurance quote
-   A mobile app with the basic elements of avatar, chat box, and a conversation area
-   Social apps which include Skype for Business, Messenger, and others
-   Voice-activated interfaces, for example, Amazon Echo
The most common interface implementations are the basic interface and the custom user interface with data collected from the conversation displayed to one side of the screen.
For all visual interfaces, there is an IPsoft UI Style Guide for Amelia that includes colors, typography, iconography, buttons & controls, user inputs, menus & selectors, and chat elements. Some of these guidelines are built into the Amelia interfaces, for example, the buttons displayed with the custom UI. Other guidelines are included as required by a project.
Here's an example of how User Interface guidelines impact possible interfaces – the website user interface, mobile, and kiosk interfaces with the custom UI – when they display image buttons.
