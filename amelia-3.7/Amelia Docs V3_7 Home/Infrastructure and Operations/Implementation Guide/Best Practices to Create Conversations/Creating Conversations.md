The ability to converse with humans using natural language is Amelia's greatest strength. However, this is not easy to accomplish. In the same way people would notice and become annoyed if a person talked to us as if they were filling out a form, conversations with Amelia need to include basic human elements.
For example, all conversations have check-in points where we confirm what we've heard or correct what someone thinks we've said. Amelia's conversations follow a straight path but they also need check-in points and other features.
With the latest version of Amelia, this is especially important as Amelia now can jump from process to process based on conversation flow with the ability to return to the person's primary goal process. The process to configure Amelia must identify opportunities to make her conversation natural, as well as help create the shortest path to meet the person's needs. This will impact BPN Ask and Say lemmas, in particular, but also configuration of her humanization features.
# Tasks Linguists Can Help With
There are many ways linguists help Amelia converse naturally with humans:
-   Review existing client chat logs, transcripts, recordings, and research to understand user utterances, as well as interview live agents about best practices, industry nuances, and FAQs. This also includes review of post-launch chats to identify areas of improvements. The analysis is qualitative, not quantitative.
-   Works with Cognitive architects to understand client processes and pain points to develop appropriate use cases. Linguists use this information to develop an ideal conversation path, or "happy path," for engineers to use when creating BPN process flows and UI elements.
-   Work with engineers to review all conversation wording and process flow. Also act as a final editor to prepare Amelia for client approval and go-live.
-   Recommend existing UI functionality to include with the dialogue to build a better user experience. Help identify further UI/UX needs and bring in additional UX resources as needed.
-   Help train Amelia to use classifiers to respond properly to user utterances. Train Goal and FAQ classifiers and use Mechanical Turk as needed.
-   Help harden Amelia by accounting for the many user questions and issues that could happen during a conversation process.
-   Work with clients to develop a list of frequently asked questions and answers to train Amelia. Review and edit answers and maintain a working file. Also create a complete copybook for client review and approval.
Linguists also work with clients to provide guidance and recommendations, as well as IPsoft Research and Development and Sales groups.
# Qualities of a Good Conversation
In conversation, Amelia acts as a person would, in addition to her role as a customer support representative. Both qualities need to be included in a successful implementation of Amelia's conversations. In interactions with end users, her success largely depends on her ability to be like a human — moreover, one who is informed, educated, helpful, direct, down-to-earth, pleasant, and easy to understand.
On a deeper level, Amelia should be empathetic and responsive to a user’s emotional state. As Amelia converses, her language must become more and more authentic, nuanced, dynamic, and insightful. Conversations should elicit delight on the part of the user. Like a human agent, she should continually strive to build rapport. And when she does, she’ll become both functional and memorable.
This section contains a working list of best practices used to determine whether Amelia is indeed ready to be deployed and interact with real-world users. It is divided into two sections. The first section addresses best practices for Amelia’s interactions with end users and the second addresses best practices related to the language itself. More details are in a document available from the Linguistics group within the IPsoft Cognitive team.
## Best Practices to Work with Customers
The best customer service agents are efficient, personable, attentive to details, and proactive. They make things pleasant and more convenient, which has a positive effect on any customer.
Let’s take a look at some of the best practices for any agent — human or virtual.
-   Greet customers with enthusiasm
-   Set expectations up front
-   Start by listening
-   Be attentive to details
-   Anticipate questions and responses
-   Empathize with the customer
-   Respect the customer's time by being efficient
-   Prefer natural responses – for example, free text – over button selections
-   Advocate for the brand and its product or service
-   Have personality.
For example, one way for Amelia to set expectations up front is to explicitly state at the start of a chat what she can help with:
*Hello, my name is Amelia and I can help you with inquiries about your account.*
Better yet, the goal can be explicit before users even open the chat. The call to action that pushes the user toward an engagement with Amelia can be written in such a way that they know what Amelia can assist them with:
*Click here to get a car insurance quote from Amelia.*

## Best Practices for Amelia's Language
Before Amelia can be deployed, she must have a strong command of the language she’s meant to use in each use case. When Amelia communicates effectively and eloquently, she begins to resemble the very best human agents — and the customer’s experience will be better for it.
-   Every word, phrase, and sentence Amelia says must be crystal clear
-   Amelia needs to be thorough without overloading people with too much information too quickly
-   She should sound natural and plainspoken like a real person, not repetitive
-   Her utterances must be proofread to remove typos and other silly errors
-   Amelia must be consistent in her word choices and how she describes parts of the conversation
For example, to help Amelia be clear in her conversations, her utterances must mean what is intended and phrased in ways to make meaning clear. Sometimes, this is as easy as rearranging the clauses and/or phrases in a sentence.
*Unclear: You must first add your dependent daughter to pay your first month’s premium.*
*Better: To pay your first month’s premium, you must first add your dependent daughter.*
