Implementations of Amelia follow an agreement with customers on a specific business case where she can make a significant difference in their organization.
Amelia key strengths are best utilized in situations with high volume or multi-step, cross-system, fragmented processes or queues. A high volume of repetitive requests, for example, provides Amelia with lots of data to refine her skills in a short period of time. Lots of support tickets, chat transcripts, and other documentation provides a strong foundation to train Amelia. These environments also allow for humans to focus on high value tasks and let Amelia handle rote repetitive tasks.
A successful implementation of an Amelia project will accomplish at least these goals:
-   An easy way for people to start a conversation with Amelia
-   People clearly know what Amelia can do and cannot do for them
-   For topics she's configured to handle, Amelia will engage in pleasant efficient conversation, escalate if needed (and let the person know if that's not possible), learn from her interactions and agent escalations, and resolve issues to the extent she can take action
-   Provide measurable business value
Successful implementations also include an end to end change management process and communication plan run before, during, and after Amelia is deployed.
