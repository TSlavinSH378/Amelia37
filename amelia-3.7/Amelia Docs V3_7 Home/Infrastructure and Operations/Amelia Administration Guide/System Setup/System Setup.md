{% version "3.x" %}
Once Amelia is setup and with a basic configuration and its default escalation queue defined, additional changes depend on the purpose of the system. Amelia includes a default set of elements which can be adapted and new ones created as needed:
-   Groups, Roles, Authentication Systems, Authentication Policies
-   Basic greeting and escalation BPNs
-   Basic response pool entries for Amelia's initial utterances in interactions
Some elements can be disabled but not deleted, for example, response pool entries, domains, and authentication policies.
This section describes how to create:
-   Domains to organize knowledge
-   Groups, roles, authentication systems, and authentication policies
-   User accounts to provide access and define actions users can perform
-   Escalation teams and queues to handle conversations passed from Amelia
-   Response pool entries to expand Amelia's initial greetings in interactions
The goals of the system will determine how many of these steps need to be taken.
