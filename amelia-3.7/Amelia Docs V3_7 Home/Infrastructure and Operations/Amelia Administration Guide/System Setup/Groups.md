Groups organize a set of users, roles, and authorities within a specific domain. For example, groups collect many users and one or more roles and authorities. Membership in a group shares with many users role access rights and authorities needed to perform specific tasks. While users can be added to groups, they cannot be added to roles. Groups also are designated at the domain level, not global.
More information about groups is found in the [User Groups](https://docs.ipsoft.com/display/AmeliaDocsV3/Access+and+Permissions#AccessandPermissions-UserGroupDefs) and [Authorities](https://docs.ipsoft.com/display/AmeliaDocsV3/Access+and+Permissions#AccessandPermissions-AuthorityDefs) parts of the [Access and Permissions](https://docs.ipsoft.com/display/AmeliaDocsV3/Access+and+Permissions) section.
## The Groups Interface
To edit or add a group, log in to Amelia's administration pages and select System Settings then Groups from the left side navigation links. The Groups workspace appears with a New User Group button at the top right.
