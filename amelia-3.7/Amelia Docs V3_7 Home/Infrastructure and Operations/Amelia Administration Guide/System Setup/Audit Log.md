A wide range of Amelia events can be searched and viewed individually and by event type. To view audit log events for a domain, the user must have the ADMIN_AUDIT_EVENT authority assigned to their user account. For events not connected to a domain, the ADMIN_AUDIT_EVENT authority must be assigned from a group with global authority.
To view events, click the System Settings link on the left side of Amelia's administration pages then click the Audit Log link to display a searchable list of events.
To display details about an audit log event, click theÂ ![](attachments/11940281/28480544.png) icon to the right of any entry in the Event Data column.
