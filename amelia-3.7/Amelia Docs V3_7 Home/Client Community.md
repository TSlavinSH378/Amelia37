The Amelia Customer Community (ACC) was created to give IPsoft clients the opportunity to learn from one another and provide feedback for future product development. Members get exclusive information about Amelia product developments and updates, the opportunity to learn from their peers, and network with like-minded industry professionals.
The Community holds monthly, customer-only calls, an annual in-person meeting before IPsoft’s Digital Workforce Summit in the spring, and a monthly webinar series on topics chosen by Community members. If you are interested in joining, please email <acc@ipsoft.com.>
# November 2, 2021: Building Prototypes with Amelia's Digital Employee Builder
will introduce a completely new way to design initial conversational flows and processes by having Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) interact directly with Amelia (preferably with a coach). The outcome is working prototypes in 30 minutes or less that can be tested and validated by other SMEs. We will be joined by our Global Director of AI Solutions Joshua Schechter, who will provide a demonstration and present some of the other projects his team is working, including the creation of best practices libraries. As always, we will be providing information on updates and sneak-peaks, as well as taking questions from our live audience.
