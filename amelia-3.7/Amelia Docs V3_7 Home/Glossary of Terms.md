| AIML | Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) is an XML dialect used by natural language software agents. Elements marked up with AIML tell agents what to say in different situations and, in some cases, how to say their response. |
| API | Application Programming Interface is a set of subroutines, data structures, communication protocols, and other tools used to build software. An API provides the building blocks used by programmers to build software applications. |
| Business Process Network (BPN) | Defines process-based interactions between Amelia and a user, for example, unlocking an account or resetting a password. |
| Classifier Model | A data set Amelia creates with intents, entities, utterances, and other data to understand conversation used to describe a topic. Algorithms process the input data to evaluate the importance and weight of words and phrases in the data set. |
| CMS | Content Management System is one or more software programs used to create, manage, and publish digital content. |
| CQA | Clarifying Question Answer (CQA) is the ability for Amelia to determine potential confusion within utterances and ask questions to clarify the user intent in the utterance. |
| CSV | Comma Separated Values is a text file where row data is separated (delimited) with commas. |
| DNN | A Deep Neural Network (DNN) Is an artificial neural network that mimics the complex neural networks in animal and human brains. DNNs have multiple layers between input and output with each layer evaluating utterances for words and the relationships between words. |
| ELMo | Embeddings from Language Model (ELMo) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model used to evaluate utterances to determine the meaning of a single word based on words around it. For example, the word bank has different meanings in the utterances, “The bank down the street was robbed” and “We had a picnic on the bank of the river.” The words robbed and river indicate the word bank has a different meaning in each sentence. |
| Entity | Data collected to complete an intent goal, for example, a date of birth for a loan application. |
| EQA | Elaborate Question Answering (EQA) involves asking dynamic follow-up questions for more information when an utterance doesn’t converge on an intent. |
| FQT | Fully Qualified Task, a task that has been evaluated as acceptable to be processed to resolution. |
| HMR | Hot Module Replacement is a feature of webpack software module bundler to allow modules to be exchanged, added, or removed while a software application runs. |
| Intent | The user’s goal, for example, to qualify for an auto loan. The goal requires a process to complete. |
| JEXL | Java Expression Language is library to provide dynamic scripting features in applications and frameworks written in the Java programming language. |
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation is a text data storage standard that uses name (key):value pairs to organize data in an ordered list easily processed by many programming languages. |
| LP | Language Pack, software that when installed provide Amelia with the ability to speak a specific language. |
| Machine Learning | The scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computers use to perform a specific task by relying on patterns and inference instead of using explicit instructions. |
| MIME | MIME (Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions) is an extension of the original Internet e-mail protocol to let people exchange different kinds of data files on the Internet, for example, audio, video, images, application programs, and other kinds, as well as the ASCII text handled in the original protocol. |
| Negative Utterances | An unlabeled training utterance, negatives help Amelia learn the difference between tasks and knowledge she is trained on and things she is not. They help Amelia understand words that are similar but have different unrelated meanings than utterances used to trigger the intent goal and Amelia’s processes. |
| NER | Named Entity Recognition is part of extracting information to locate named entity mentions in unstructured text then classify the entities into categories, for example, person names, organizations, and date/time expressions. |
| NLP | Natural Language Processing (NLP) mixes computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence to program computers to analyze and understand natural human language, the unconstructed casual way people talk. |
| NLU | Natural Language Understanding (NLU) uses machine learning to convert unstructured inputs into structured forms machines can understand and act upon to determine user intent. Machines are less able than humans to handle mispronunciations, swapped words, contractions, and other unstructured and unpredictable inputs. NLU is a subset of NLP. |
| NPE | NullPointerException is a Java RuntimeException. In Java, a special null value can be assigned to an object reference. A NullPointerException is thrown when an application attempts to use an object reference that has the null value. |
| PSA | The Personal Speech Act (PSA) is a classifier used to identify insults and compliments. |
| SAML | Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard used to exchange authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider. SAML is an XML-based markup language. |
| SpEL | Spring Express Language is a programming language that supports querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime. |
| SSL | Secure Sockets Layer is a security technology to establish an encrypted link between a web server and web browsers. |
| TLS | Transport Layer Security (TLS), and its now-deprecated predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network. Websites use TLS to secure all communications between their servers and web browsers. |
| TSV | Tab Separated Values is a text file where row data is separated (delimited) with tabs. |
| Utterance | Words that represent a natural language sentence, for example, "I want to reset my password." A variety of possible utterances a person might say in a conversation are used to train Amelia. |
