Amelia software installations include URLs to view guides for their REST API interfaces. Multiple versions of the guide are available. There are two web versions, a multi-page interactive guide and a single page HTML version that is not interactive. There's also a PDF version of the guide available.
If you do not have access to an Amelia installation, please speak to your IPsoft Account/Partner contact.
# Multi-Page Web Version
The current REST API for an Amelia installation is available as a set of interactive web pages with this URL pattern:
``` groovy
<amelia_domain_URL>/AmeliaRest/swagger-ui.html
```
For example, this URL would display a web page REST guide for an Amelia installation:
``` groovy
https://amelia.yourcompany.com/AmeliaRest/swagger-ui.html
```
# PDF and Single Page HTML Versions
In addition, PDF and HTML versions for the REST API guide are available with this URL pattern:
``` groovy
<amelia_domain_url>/AmeliaRest/docs/
```
For example, this URL would display links to PDF and HTML versions for an Amelia installation:
``` groovy
https://amelia.yourcompany.com/AmeliaRest/docs/
```
