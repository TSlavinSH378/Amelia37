Amelia SDK for Android

3.1.3
Modified API to accomodate initial bpn variable:
For anonymous login:
    void startNewConversation(Map<String,String> initialAttributes,Map<String,String> initialBpnVariables);
For authenticated login:
    loginOptions.setInitialBpnVariables(Map<String,String> initialBpnVariables);
Note: Both bpn variables and initial attributes are optional. For example, if only passing in initial attributes
to start an anonymous chat:
    ameliaChat.startNewConversation(attributeMap, null);

-Fixed SSO cookie persistence issue.

API changes to pass in initial attributes when new conversation starts:

Added new method startNewConversation with the initialAttributes as parameter:
    void startNewConversation(Map<String,String> initialAttributes);

     setInitialAttributes(Map<String,String> initialAttributes);

SAD,SIMPLE_SMILE,SINCERE_SMILE,SMIRK_LEFT,SMIRK_RIGHT,SURPRISED

-ameliaChat.setAllowAnonymous(boolean) has been removed. This is a server decision and should
not be set on  client side.

-added anonymous login. Using ameliaChat.newConversation() will start an anonymous chat.
On the other hand, with ameliaChat.stepupLogin() will trigger logged required to be called.

-Added initialize() method. This should be called at the start of the chat, when amelia settings
has been changed, for example, the amelia server url was changed by user. The sdk will correspondly
return ISessionInfo in sessionInitialized:
    void sessionInitialized(ISessionInfo sessionInfo);
ISessionInfo contains information about the server (i.e. whether anonymous is allowed)
as well as the currently logged in user. Usually on session init, anonymous user is logged in
 and returned in the User object of ISessionInfo.
For examples of usages, please refer to the updated demo that comes with Amelia Android sdk v3.1.0.
